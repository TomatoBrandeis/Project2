                                    <p class="card-text">When working with the tinker cad design to make 3d, it was extremely simple and easy to use and understand. The tutorials were very clear and there is a lack/less confusing buttons that just allow you to create a simple and easy design, but with a more complex design, it will be extremely difficult to create. This does limit the tool to the materials and shapes available unless you want to draw your own shape.

                                    <p class="card-text">The design and creation of the "simple" design from tinker cad was much harder to create in Fusion. The tutorials were much harder to understand compared to the tinker cad tutorials as there were a lot to go through in comparison. Fusion is made more for complex designs that require rendering and simulations which allows much more complex shapes to be created (if you get familiar with the tool). Overall, it is much harder to use and more time-consuming, but the design could be much more complex.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The addition that I made to the headset stand was a phone holster/holder in order to charge my phone with my headset at the same time when I go to sleep. I used fusion 360 in order to add the design for this 3d print, which seemed easy but became harder than I thought. It was harder to navigate my way through fusion 360 and attempt to find the "hole" function that tinker-cad has, which allows me to create a hole through any object in any shape I wished. It was also harder to create the curve on the holster for the phone which required me to create it in 3 separate pieces attached onto the actual headset stand. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Due to the shape of the headset stand, I had to generate supporting beams on the print in order to make sure that the print did not bend over when created. I also could not create the item to scale (for a headset) as the scale was much bigger than that of the 3d printer. I had to scale it down to roughly 1/5 of the size in order to print it out in time for the project. The design was much harder to create and navigate through the fusion 360 due to the many limitations and errors. Sometimes I could not tilt the blocks (or drawings) into the way I wanted to, or they would just merge/fuse together when I did not want them to. It was also hard to find out how to create a "hole" into the object (for the phone stand) like I can inside of Tinker Cad.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The design was very much more of a failure than not. The design was hard to remove the stabilizers and was too small and fragile to handle properly. If I could, I would have made the size much bigger and much more stable to print. The stabilizers would also have been much more but easier to remove than the current (very small) model.</p>

I added a larger section on the left of the spice rack to store any large salt and pepper grinders. Using Tinker Cad to add this onto the downloaded design was much easier since Tinker Cad allows shapes and the hole function to be made much easier.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Due to the size (as stated in the previous print), the project was too big for the printer and had to be massively scaled down to the size of my hands. This design, made in Tinker Cad, is a much simpler and easier to create. I chose the spice rack since the headset stand was much too big of a file. The downside of using Tinker Cad is the file size limit (25mb) when the headset stand was ~ 27 mb. Using Tinker Cad, I was able to create a rectangle the length of the original print (shown on the left side) and split into 2 pieces. I was also able to create 2 holes in the rectangle to create a pivot/ditch for other spices. It was very simple and took no more than 5 minutes to create and download this project into an STL file for the prusca slicer. I could optimize this design further by removing the bars on the right (the hanging  handle) to reduce the size and create a mirror of the left side onto the right or create spice racks for a single spice at a time. I believed that this did achieve my goal of creating a spice rack, albeit extremely small and practically unusuable.</p>
